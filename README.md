## Directions:

* You must upload the pseudocode for each sorting algorithm to your repo.

* In Driver.java, you must randomly generate an array that will be sent as an argument when you call the sorting methods.

* Do not use an ArrayList
  
* The methods in Sorts.java should be void 

* Print the status of your array after each step/iteration performed by your algorithm (outer loop only). This is a good way to debug your code and make sure your algorithm is working properly.
  
* Do not use recursion.
