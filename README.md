## Directions:

* You must upload the pseudocode for each sorting algorithm to your repo.

* In Driver.java, you must randomly generate an array that will be sent as an argument when you call the sorting methods. If you want to reuse the same random array for all sorting algoritms you must generate copies of your array (Arrays.copyOf() or Objects.clone()).

* Do not use an ArrayList.
  
* The methods in Sorts.java should be static and void.

* Print the status of your array after each step/iteration performed by your algorithm (outer loop only). This is a good way to debug your code and make sure your algorithm is working properly.
  
* Do not use recursion.
